# Madlibs in Android Studio

This android app allows the user to play the game Madlibs.
Upon clicking the start button this app randomly selects one of 5 textfiles and allows the user to fill in the placeholders. Then, the text will be revealed with the filled in words after which the user can start over.


## Features

A few things this app has built in:

* Randomly select one of the text files in the assets folder.
* Start new activity through intent.
* Rotation of user interface support.
* Data preservation upon rotation.
* Back navigation to the startscreen.
